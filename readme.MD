# Character Frequency Statistics in C

This repository contains a system developed in C that calculates and manages the statistics of character frequency within text files, distinguishing letters, digits, spaces, punctuation, and other characters. It's capable of creating "clusters" for advanced analytics such as differentiating between uppercase and lowercase characters.

## System Overview

The system comprises multiple components that work in tandem to compute character frequency statistics:

1. **Counter Process (C):** The main process that receives and tracks character counts from its child processes.
2. **Pi Process:** Child processes of 'C' that manage a subset of the input data.
3. **Qi, j Process:** Child processes of 'Pi' that analyze portions of each input file.
4. **Analyzer Process (A):** Calculates the statistics, incorporating the functionality of 'C' and its child processes.
5. **Report Process (R):** Retrieves the statistical information generated by 'A'.
6. **Main Process (M):** Acts as the command center and user interface, invoking 'A' and 'R' processes.

## Features

- **Efficient Character Frequency Analysis:** Analyzes text files and computes character frequency statistics, including distinctions between cases and aggregates.
- **Dynamically Scalable:** Adjusts the number of child processes to optimize performance.
- **Flexible:** Handles new inputs, removes existing ones, and modifies parameters dynamically.
- **Interactive Shell:** Provides an interface for users to interact with the system.

## Usage

1. **First Launch:** On initial launch, pass in data to be analyzed along with parameters 'n' and 'm' that denote the number of 'Pi' and 'Qi, j' processes respectively. 
2. **Reports:** View reports on screen with statistical results in various modes such as general statistics, per cluster, and more.
3. **Modify Parameters:** Adjust parameters 'n' and 'm' "on-the-fly" for greater control over the system's performance.

This repository is a demonstration of efficient multi-process system design in C, perfect for large-scale text data analysis. It's a great example of how to use multiple processes for intensive data tasks.
